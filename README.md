# CyberTape

My front end developer degree project.

A serverless application for music hunters, built with vue.js and Spotify's API.
There's a discover page where you can pick one of Spotify's categories to create a mix of some top tracks in that category. The main attraction is the mixer page though, where you can make a much more refined selection to base the mix/playlist on. When the playlist is ready, just add a name to it and iit will appear on your Spotify account!

Deployed on [Vercel](https://cybertape.vercel.app/login)

*Disclaimer: Cybertape is still in development on Spotify, so I only have a limited set of slots for user access. Hit me up with your Spotify account's email if you want to test it out :)

Instrumental- range slider value does not work at the moment, so please don't use that one :)
